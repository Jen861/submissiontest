                    <p>Founded in Bray in 2020, DiMario's offers a wide range of classic and very innovative gourmet pizzas to create a distinctive and contemporary eating style for you to enjoy at home. Founder Mario has spend his early days in Napoli, learning traditional levain sourdough bread making, Romano & Neapolitan cooking techniques, sourcing the best quality ingredients and honing his taste buds to bring you the pizzas that dreams are made of.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We are proud to house one of the first Neapolitan wood-burning pizza ovens hand built in Dublin by real Neapolitan Artisans –  built to fit onsite using ancient Neapolitan techniques. It was not just the stones and clay from Naples they imported back but incredibly the oven maker himself!</p> </div>
